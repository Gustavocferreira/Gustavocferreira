👨‍💻 About Me
Currently, I work at the Instituto do Legislativo Paulista – Assembleia Legislativa de São Paulo (Alesp). My primary role involves the modernization of SAPL (Legislative Process Support System) and various government transparency portals.

I am deeply committed to building robust and inclusive public-facing applications, focusing on:

Accessibility: Ensuring interfaces meet strict standards like WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and eMAG (Brazilian Government Accessibility Model).

Data Privacy: Maintaining strict compliance with LGPD (Brazil's General Data Protection Law, analogous to GDPR).

Interoperability: Implementing e-Ping (Electronic Government Interoperability Standards) to ensure seamless and secure communication between government systems.

🎓 Education: B.Sc. in Information Technology — Univesp (Universidade Virtual do Estado de São Paulo).

🎯 Current Focus
Building modern full-stack applications utilizing Next.js and Python.

Developing and maintaining critical government systems and high-traffic transparency portals.

Advocating for and implementing accessibility-first development and system interoperability.
